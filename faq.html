      <h2 class="faq-question">What types of dogs can jog?</h2>
      <div class="faq-answer">It depends — both small and large dogs are capable of running, but this decision is more about your dog’s energy level, body type, and endurance. For example, we run 10-pound terriers and 100-pound great pyrenees crosses. Both of these dogs have vet approval. If you aren’t sure if your dog should jog, speak to your vet or sign them up for our dog walks!</div>

      <h2 class="faq-question">Do you operate in all weather?</h2>
      <div class="faq-answer">Yes! Rain or shine (and during snowy days too) we take your pup out for their service, unless there are extreme weather conditions that are unsafe, such as: thunderstorms, lightning, hail, and extreme cold or heat.

        We will still walk/jog on hot summer days and cold winter days, but let us know what you know about your dog’s comfort level. Ultimately, hot/cold decisions are up to you!</div>
