                A little about our training methods:

We understand that training your dog can be a challenging journey. That’s why our training method focuses on the power of positive reinforcement and creates an errorless learning environment for your pup.

Our approach starts with reinforcing the foundational building blocks of the behavior you want to train or replace. We believe in setting your dog up for success from the beginning, ensuring that they feel confident and engaged throughout the training sessions. By gradually increasing the challenge, we keep your furry friend enthusiastic and eager to learn.

We also address any negative emotional responses your dog may have, such as reactivity or aggression. Our experienced trainers work in a positive environment, carefully managing your dog’s threshold and introducing them to their triggers in a controlled manner. Through counterconditioning and desensitization techniques, we help your dog develop new, positive associations with previously challenging situations.

With our tailored training programs, we aim to create a harmonious and joyful bond between you and your canine companion. Together, we’ll find your dog’s full potential and help them become a confident, well-behaved member of your family.

                The women who own and operate Dog Line are competent and professional in every way. 
                <br>They and their staff provide one of the best and most consistent services that I have ever encountered in any customer interaction.
                <br> They accommodate their clients’ schedules cheerfully. They love and respect dogs and clearly show it. 
                <br>The dogs are totally responsive to this care. Positive reinforcement is the only method used with these beloved animal friends. 
                <br>My and my dog’s experiences have been exemplary, he is fit and happy and Dog Jogs has helped us weather several situations, including the uncertainties of COVID. I highly recommend them.
